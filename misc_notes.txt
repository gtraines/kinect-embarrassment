cd /etc/udev/rules.d/

sudo nano kinect.rules

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="045e", MODE:="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", ATTRS{idVendor}=="045e", MODE:="0666"

sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
Put this udev file in your /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory. This udev file will grant read and write access to ALL users, include non-privileged users, for ALL USB devices that have a matching Vendor ID. This means your device is accessible to non-root users even without modifying your executable or running it with sudo.

This didn't work for me until I added a colon to bit that sets the mode value: MODE:="0666". I also only needed the usb line, and not the usb_device one. I'm using Debian

After adding rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/ something like:
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1234", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1234", MODE="0666", OWNER="YOU_USER_ID"

do not forget to reload rules with:

$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
